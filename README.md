# Cows-Bulls
Very famous game. You are doing to play against a computer.
    Rules in a nutshell:
    A computer generates a 4 digit number where each digit is unique.
    Your guess should be a 4 digit number as well.
    For each correct digit you get a Bull if it is in a correct place or a Cow if a digit is correct, but place is wrong. 
    
    I guess I should improve something in this code, like add function that checks if an input number contains unique digits.
    I would appreciate any help and improvement, please feel free to add your branches.
